### Markdown Style
Markdown file may look weird if you don't install my own style, get style.css [here](https://github.com/HxxWorkAccount/Markdown-Google-Style).

### Build Project
If you want to build this project, you need to change the `CMakeLists.txt` in root folder to import dependencies correctly (I only write that for my M1-MacBook).
