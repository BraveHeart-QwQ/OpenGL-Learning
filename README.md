Markdown file may look weird if you don't install my custom style, get style.css [here](https://github.com/HxxWorkAccount/Markdown-Google-Style).

### Build Project
1. Modified the `CMakeLists.txt` in root folder to fit your computer enviroment.
1. New folder in root `./Build`
1. Cmake `cmake --build ./Build --config Debug --target all -j 10`
1. Run executable target `./Build/Source/Run`

If you want to build this project, you probably need to change the `CMakeLists.txt` in root folder to import dependencies correctly. (I only wrote that for my M1-MacBook and didn't consider any deployment which is because I'm a beginner of CMake).
